	~	"In the Pathway, annual electric use from all EVs will reach 8% of total \
		electricity demand by 2030, significant but manageable. Maximizing the \
		utilization of existing grids and keeping them in balance as more \
		renewable generation gets added to the mix will be crucial to ensuring a \
		cost-effective transition to an electrified transportation fleet. For \
		example, a modernized and digitized network can support intelligent \
		management of EV charging so that it doesnâ€™t overload the grid. Making \
		electric rates more dynamic and transparent will facilitate this \
		intelligent charging, and will increase savings for consumers opting to \
		drive electric." - \
