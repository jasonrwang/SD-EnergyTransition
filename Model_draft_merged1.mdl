		grids and keeping them in balance as more renewable generation gets added \
		to the mix will be crucial to ensuring a cost-effective transition to an \
		electrified transportation fleet. For example, a modernized and digitized \
		network can support intelligent management of EV charging so that it \
		doesnât overload the grid. Making electric rates more dynamic and \
		transparent will facilitate this intelligent charging, and will increase \
		savings for consumers opting to drive electric." - \
